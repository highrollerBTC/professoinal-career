# 🛡️ Clarity Smart Contract Security Audits (Pro-Bono)

**Offering security audits for Clarity smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain**  

---

## 🔍 What I Offer  
- **Security-Focused Pseudo-Audit:** A thorough review of your contract to identify potential bugs, vulnerabilities, and limitations.  
- **Fast Turnaround:**  
  - **Small to Medium Contracts:** 48 to 72 hours.  
  - **Large Contracts:** Up to a week.  
  - *Delays may occur based on workload, but I’ll notify you if so.*  
- **Pro-Bono for Real Stacks Projects:** Security is crucial, and I know audits can be expensive. If you're building something meaningful on Stacks, I'll review your contract for free.  
- **Honest and Transparent:** While this isn't a **certified** audit, I aim to give developers peace of mind by quickly identifying critical issues.  
- **Not an Extensive Audit:** If you need a full rebuild, deeper testing, or formal verification, we can discuss further options.  

---

## 🚀 Why I'm Doing This  
- I've built and secured Clarity contracts myself. I know how crucial security is, and I want to help projects ship safer smart contracts.  
- I believe in Stacks and want to support real builders who may not have the resources for a full-scale audit.

## 💡 How to Request an Audit  
If you need a Clarity audit or just contract help:  
1. **DM me** or open an **issue** in this repository with your contract details.  
2. I'll review the contract and provide feedback within the stated timeframe.  
3. If you appreciate the work, you can send a small token of appreciation to `highroller.btc` (but seriously, it's pro-bono—no pressure).

## 🛠 What I Look For in an Audit  
- 🐞 **Bugs & Vulnerabilities:** Logical flaws, unintended behavior, edge cases.  
- 🔐 **Security Risks:** Reentrancy risks, unintended state changes, access control issues.  
- 📉 **Gas Efficiency & Performance:** Cost optimizations for better execution efficiency.  
- ⚠️ **Limitations & Warnings:** Possible future issues that could arise with contract upgrades or changes.  
- ✅ **Best Practices:** Ensuring your contract follows recommended Clarity coding patterns.

## 📌 Disclaimer  
- This audit is **not a replacement for a certified security audit** by an established firm.  
- My findings should be used as **guidance**, not a final security verdict.  
- You are responsible for testing and securing your smart contract before deployment.
